# Machine Learning Features Selection

This repository is dedicated to feature selection techniques in machine learning, aimed at identifying the most relevant features that contribute to predictive accuracy and model performance.

## Overview

Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning pipelines, helping to:
- Improve model performance by removing irrelevant or redundant features.
- Reduce overfitting and complexity.
- Decrease training time and enhance interpretability.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find code implementations and detailed explanations of various feature selection methods.

## Techniques Covered

1. **Filter Methods**
   - **Correlation Coefficients:** Selecting features based on their correlation with the target variable.
   - **Chi-Square Test:** Evaluating the significance of each feature for categorical target variables.
   - **Variance Threshold:** Removing features with low variance.

2. **Wrapper Methods**
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Iteratively removing features and building models to select the most important ones.
   - **Forward/Backward Selection:** Adding or removing features based on model performance.

3. **Embedded Methods**
   - **Lasso (L1) Regularization:** Shrinking coefficients to zero for less important features.
   - **Tree-based Methods:** Using feature importance scores from decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
